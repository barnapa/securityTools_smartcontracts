# securityTools_smartcontracts


I.  Tools:
1) SLITHER
https://github.com/crytic/slither

Features
Detects vulnerable Solidity code with low false positives (see the list of trophies)
Identifies where the error condition occurs in the source code
Easily integrates into continuous integration and Hardhat/Foundry builds
Built-in 'printers' quickly report crucial contract information
Detector API to write custom analyses in Python
Ability to analyze contracts written with Solidity >= 0.4
Intermediate representation (SlithIR) enables simple, high-precision analyses
Correctly parses 99.9% of all public Solidity code
Average execution time of less than 1 second per contract
Integrates with Github's code scanning in CI

It is very popular and easy to use tool.

2) MYTHRIL
   still free of charge
https://github.com/Consensys/mythril

Mythril is a security analysis tool for EVM bytecode. It detects security vulnerabilities in smart contracts built for Ethereum, Hedera, Quorum, Vechain, Roostock, Tron and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It uses symbolic execution, SMT solving and taint analysis to detect a variety of security vulnerabilities. It's also used (in combination with other tools and techniques) in the MythX security analysis platform.

3) MYTHX
https://github.com/muellerberndt/awesome-mythx-smart-contract-security-tools
MythX is a smart contract security analysis API that supports Ethereum, Quorum, Vechain, Roostock, Tron and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It uses static analysis, symbolic execution and input fuzzing to detect security bugs and verify the correctness of smart contract code.
